icebreaker (this is an old design. new one is coming)

Dating app for situations when you see somebody you like in a public space (e.g. in a coffee shop) but can’t start talking to this person (too shy or one of you is with friends or mom). If both of you are interested in each other and have this app on your phones – it connects you and opens a chat so you can start messaging and move forward.

You log in with facebook account (app takes your age, gender and profile picture). Then you describe your current look and look of this person using a paper doll kinda tool (and this person does the same). If your mutual descriptions match (60% or more) – you can start chatting in the app and will be able to see each others profile pictures and age. 

I use preview from iPhone rear camera as a background of the app – so background is transparent and dynamic. I put a dark blur filter on top of it – so it does not really distract you.
